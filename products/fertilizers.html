      <div class="container">
        <h2>Don’t waste your time — our scat is the best!
        </h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <h3>You will be our first priority, not our number two
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you need fertilizer right now because your grass is telling you to answer nature’s call, don’t make an ass of yourself and fail to call us. No matter what we are doing, we will consider your request a code brown, get off the stool we are sitting on, and discharge our duty to you by getting over to your place in a deuce. Our families don’t matter. If we have to drop the kids off at the pool to hurry over to you, then consider those kids droppings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our feeling is, you don’t need the mess. You need us to get into motion quick, get out of the muck we’re in, and evacuate whatever crap we’re currently knee deep in so we can help you. It doesn’t matter if you want our day compost or our night soil, we will provide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t poo-poo what we’re promising. We are nothing if not regular. When we are working on someone’s lawn, we’ll go at least once a day and sometimes twice if there’s a lot to take in.
            </p>

            <h3>Grow better fruits & vegetables</h3>
            <p>
              Our fertilizers will help your crop yields multiply, providing you with incredible amounts of your favorite fruits and vegetables, like horse apples and stink pickles. After the harvest, you can make delicious treats like meadow muffins or cow pies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feeling more ambitious? Drop some potatoes in the crockpot or bake some bread and then pinch a nice loaf. Squeeze some chocolate on that loaf with Hershey squirts, and you’ll have something people will talk about for years to come! In fact, some of our past clients made such great cocoa-based treats that people pointed guns at them and demanded that they bake nut-brown goodies for them. Fortunately, one of our employees, a Mr. Egesta, had a background in law enforcement and was able to negotiate the release of the chocolate hostages.
            </p>

            <h3>You can actually make money</h3>
            <p>
              Here’s a nice side benefit: if there’s a body of water on your property, some of that fertilizer will end up in there, helping you to stock the lake with brown trout. Charge people to visit your property for a little fishing and soon you will be making a deposit into the porcelain bank of your choice!
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: if our special fertilizer should accidentally release the Kraken in your pond, we will bring our special train full of anti-Kraken filth to your place and unloose the caboose, as we like to put it. Likewise for any Coprolites that may appear.
